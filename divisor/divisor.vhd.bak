entity divisor IS

	port
	(

	CLK: IN STD_LOGIC;
	out1, out2: BUFFER STD_LOGIC


	);
end divisor;

architecture example of divisor is

	SIGNAL count1: INTEGER RANGE 0 TO 25000000;

begin
	PROCESS (clk)
		VARIABLE count2 : INTEGER RANGE 0 TO 25000000;

	BEGIN
		IF (clk'EVENT AND clk= '1') THEN
		count1 <= count1 +1;
		count2 := count2 +1;

			IF (count1= 24999999) THEN
			out1 <= NOT out1;
			count1 <= 0;
			end IF;
			IF (count2= 25000000) THEN
			out2 <= NOT out2;
			count2 := 0;

			END IF;
		END IF;
	END PROCESS;
